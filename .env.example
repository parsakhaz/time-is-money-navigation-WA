# Time is Money Router - Environment Variables

# No environment variables are required for basic development!
# The app works out of the box using the public OSRM routing service.

# Optional: Use a custom OSRM server
# Uncomment and set this to use a different routing service
# OSRM_URL=https://your-custom-osrm-server.com

# For local development with Docker OSRM (advanced, not recommended):
# OSRM_URL=http://localhost:5000
